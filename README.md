# Diabetes-Prediction
🩺 Diabetes Prediction System
A machine learning-based web application to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on various medical parameters. Built and trained using Python and Google Colab.

📌 Project Overview
This project uses supervised learning to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The model is trained in Google Colab using libraries like scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The final model can be integrated into a web app for user-friendly predictions.
